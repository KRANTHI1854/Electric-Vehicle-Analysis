# üöó Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard

## üìñ About the Project
The **Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard** provides a detailed visualization of Electric Vehicle (EV) statistics, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. This dashboard was created using **Power BI** and leverages **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) for dynamic calculations. It focuses on analyzing total vehicles, electric range, vehicle types, makes, models, and their distribution across states and years.
